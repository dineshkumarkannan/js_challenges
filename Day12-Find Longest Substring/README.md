## Day 12

# Challenge 1: Find Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Task: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```js
//Example: Input: "abcabcbb";
// Output: 3 (The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.)
```

# Challenge 2: "Character Frequency Sort"

Problem:
Given a string, return a new string where the characters are sorted in descending order based on their frequency.

```js
// Input: "tree"
// Output: "eert"
```

# Challenge 3 : Challenge: Check for Anagram Pairs

Write a function areAnagrams(str1, str2) that returns true if the two strings are anagrams of each other (same letters, same frequency, regardless of order and case), and false otherwise.

```js
areAnagrams("Listen", "Silent"); // true
areAnagrams("hello", "world"); // false
```

# Challenge 4: Group Words by Anagram

Given an array of words, group all the anagrams together.

```js
Input: ["listen", "silent", "enlist", "hello", "below", "elbow"];
Output: [["listen", "silent", "enlist"], ["hello"], ["below", "elbow"]];
```

# Challenge 5: Longest Word in a Sentence

Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the longest word in that sentence. If there are multiple words with the same maximum length, return all of them.

```js
longestWords("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
// Output: ["quick", "jumps"]
```
