# Day 02 â€“ Objects + DOM Interaction

## ðŸ§  Goal:

- Practice object creation and accessing properties
- Use JavaScript to insert content into the DOM dynamically

## ðŸ’¬ Task:

You're given a JavaScript object representing a user. Your job is to:

1. Write a function `getUserInfo(user)` that returns a formatted string with the user's name and age.
2. Add the result to a `<div>` with the ID `#output` in the HTML.

## ðŸ“¦ Example Object:

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 28,
  email: "alice@example.com",
};
```
