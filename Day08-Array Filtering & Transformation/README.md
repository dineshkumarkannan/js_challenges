You have an array of product objects. Write a function to:

Filter out products that are out of stock

Create a new array with just the product names in uppercase

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Keyboard", inStock: true },
  { name: "Monitor", inStock: false },
  { name: "Mouse", inStock: true },
  { name: "Webcam", inStock: false },
];

// Output: ["KEYBOARD", "MOUSE"]
```
